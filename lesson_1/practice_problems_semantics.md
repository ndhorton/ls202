# 1:7 Practice Problems: Semantics

1.

Semantic:
article, aside, footer, h3, header, section, strong, b

Not semantic:
div, span

In HTML5, all content tags except `<div>` and `<span>` have semantic meaning. In particular, both <b> and <i> have semantic meaning. Some developers may tell you otherwise, but that's a holdover from HTML4, in which both elements are non-semantic. Note, though, that the semantic meanings of `<b>` and `<i>` in HTML5 are somewhat subtle. Avoid using them solely for stylistic purposes, and be sure you understand when they are appropriate.

2.

`<article>`, since the content has a heading and could be reused as a discrete piece of content

'However, semantics depend on context and intent, so whether we treat the Gettysburg address as an `<article>` or `<section>` or `<aside>` may vary from one page to another.'

3.

`<blockquote>`

4.

`<section>`

5.

`<aside>`

Try to avoid non-semantic tags and try not to misuse the semantic tags.
