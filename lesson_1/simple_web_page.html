      <h1>Hello, Internet!</h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to my website! It's a work in progress as I learn <strong>HTML</strong> and
        <strong>CSS</strong> from a <em>terrific</em> class I'm taking at
        <a href="https://launchschool.com">Launch School</a>. I'm learning a lot!
        Why don't you join me?

    <p class="main-text">
      There's not a lot of material on this page as I'm playing around with
      HTML &amp; CSS. When I'm done, these last two paragraphs will take on a
      lighter color than the first - the "class" attribute on the two
      <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tags and a bit of CSS will help accomplish that.
    </p>
    
    <p class="main-text" id="final-paragraph">
      This is the final paragraph. It also uses the `class` attribute as well
      as an `id` attribute. We'll use some CSS and the `id` attribute to
      underline the entire paragraph.
