      /* breakpoints:
        less than 654px width
                              - speakers 3 column layout changes to 2 column
                              - schedule changes layout
                              - nav bar disappears
                              - header changes height

        So the only definite breakpoint is at 653/654 width. There are some fluid
        sections where variable numbers of columns change based on the size of the
        window, but should these also be dealt with using media queries?

                to the npm registry and has authored about 300 open source projects on
                GitHub scattered across various organizations. Tim also teaches local

                I started coding during primary school being inspired by older brothers'
                home assignments. During years I developed bigger and smaller apps in
                various programming languages, both as professional and personal pet
                projects. Not being satisfied with innovativeness of the tasks, I started
                applying for fully remote positions at startup companies to work on cutting edge projects which could better utilize my skill set. Currently I'm
                working in a test-centered company that strongly believes in automated
                testing solutions. We provide infrastructure and work on making testing
                more accessible for every developer. I've been contributing to open source
                projects such as: WD.js, Selenium Builder and Appium.
